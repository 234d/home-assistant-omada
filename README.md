# Home Assistant Omada Add-On
This add-on brings the Omada Controller directly into Home Assistant running on a Raspberry Pi.

The stable version is based on omada v5.0, while the current beta is at version 5.8.

# About this Add-On
This add-on is a fork of Matt Bentleys [docker-omada-cotroller](https://github.com/mbentley/docker-omada-controller)  would not have been possible without his excellent work. Other than in the original docker omada controller, this add-on stores all persistent data in the /data directory, so that it is compatible with Home assistant.
