# Home Assistant Omada Add-On
This add-on brings the Omada Controller directly into Home Assistant running on a Raspberry Pi.

Currently, this Add-On  only works for aarch64-based Home Assistant installations. Please open an issue, if you want support for another platform. Pull-Requests for other architectures are also welcome. 


# Contribution 
This add-on is a fork of Matt Bentleys [docker-omada-cotroller](https://github.com/mbentley/docker-omada-controller) and would not have been possible without his excellent work. Other than in the original docker omada controller, this add-on stores all persistent data in the /data directory, so that it is compatible with Home assistant.
